ELEMENTLE


Elementle is a puzzle game for guessing a mystery chemical element within 6 tries. In addition to text-based clues (atomic number, symbol match, group, period), the page shows a blank periodic table highlighting the answer’s location from the start and coloring your incorrect guesses.



HOW TO PLAY

GOAL: Identify the mystery element in up to 6 guesses.

ENTER GUESSES: Start typing an element’s name (you’ll see an autocomplete list of valid element names).

SUBMIT: Click “Submit” or press Enter after typing your guess.



CLUES

ATOMIC #: The game will show you if your guess’s atomic number is correct (=), higher (↓), or lower (↑) than the mystery element.

SYMBOL MATCH: Displays “correct” if symbols match (e.g., “H” vs “H”), otherwise “wrong.”

GROUP/PERIOD: Displays whether you matched the group/period or not.

PERIODIC TABLE:The table is rendered as gray squares. The mystery element’s square is black, so you know the location from the start. Any squares you guess incorrectly turn dark red, so you can keep track of your tries visually.

WIN OR LOSE: If you guess the element (matching name exactly), the game ends. If you run out of 6 tries, the mystery element is revealed.
